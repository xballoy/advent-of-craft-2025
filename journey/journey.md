# My Advent of Craft 2025 Journey

## My Logs

### Day 1

- Stack(s) & exercise I touched: [memories/2024/exercise/ts/day01](../memories/2024/exercise/ts/day01)
- Key reflection I picked:
	- It's hard to pick the right tool, I used Sonar in the end but had to lower (a lot) the threshold.
    - It's important to follow complexity but this should not become a metric (otherwise the metric will be wrong).

### Day 2

- Stack(s) & exercise I touched: [memories/2024/exercise/scala/day02](../memories/2024/exercise/scala/day02)
- Key reflection I picked:
    - Know your tools. I tried (and failed) to use Zed and Scala but the integration was not great (no "play" button to run the tests, need to install a lot of things...).
    - I fall-backed to IntelliJ in the end, super smooth.
    - I used Claude Code to plan and execute the plan but telling it I'm learning Scala to have explanation on the code. This was a good idea.
    - I love the solution using lambda pattern matching!

As you go, list rules you want to carry into the next loop, e.g.:
